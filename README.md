# Java-Algorithms-and-Data-Structures
This repository contains Java implementations of different algorithms and data structures. It includes implementations of Priority Queue, Linked List, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Binary Search Tree. 

## How to run?
To run the Java files in this repository, you need to have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system. You can download and install JDK from [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).

Once you have JDK installed, you can compile and run the Java files using the following steps:
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
   
2. Navigate to the directory containing the Java file you want to run.
   
3. Compile the Java file using the `javac` command. For example: `javac Main.java`
   
4. After successful compilation, you can run the compiled class file using the `java` command. For example: `java Main`
   
## Contents
- **BinarySearchTree**: Implementation of a binary search tree data structure.
- **LinkedList**: Implementation of a singly linked list data structure.
- **MergeSort**: Implementation of the merge sort algorithm.
- **PriorityQueue**: Implementation of a priority queue data structure.
- **QuickSort**: Implementation of the quick sort algorithm.

Each folder contains Java files for the respective data structure or algorithm along with a `Main.java` file for testing.
